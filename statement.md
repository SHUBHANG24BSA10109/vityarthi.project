# Project Statement — Library Book Management System

# Problem Statement
Most small and medium-scale libraries still depend on handwritten registers to maintain book records and member details.  
Manual record keeping leads to difficulties such as misplaced books, incorrect availability status, slow searching, and a lack of history of issued and returned books.  
Therefore, there is a need for a digital system that can make library operations faster, organized, and error-free.

# Scope of the Project
The scope of this project is to develop a desktop-based library management application using Java Swing.  
The system allows the librarian to manage books, members, and book transactions digitally.  
It covers book entry, member registration, issuing and returning books, and viewing transaction history.  
The project is designed for offline use and does not require an internet connection or server.

# Target Users
The application is mainly designed for:
- School libraries
- College and university libraries
- Coaching and institute libraries
- Small public libraries
- Personal/book-club libraries

The primary users of the system are librarians or library staff members who are responsible for book management.

# High-Level Features
- Manage books (add, update, delete, search)
- Manage library members (add, update, delete)
- Issue and return books with automatic date tracking
- Maintain total and available copies of each book
- Store complete transaction history of each issued/returned book
- Restricts deletion of books or members if active transactions exist
