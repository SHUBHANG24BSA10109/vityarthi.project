# 📚 University Library Management System


##  About the Project
This project is a desktop application I built for my **CSE2006: Programming in Java** course. It solves the problem of manual library record-keeping by allowing librarians to store book details and track borrowed items digitally.

Instead of writing everything in paper registers, this system uses **Java Swing** for the interface and **File Handling/Database** to save data permanently. It was designed to check if a book is available before issuing it and to calculate fines for late returns.

##  Key Features
* **Manage Books:** Add new books, update quantities, or delete old records.
* **Issue & Return:** A simple workflow to issue books to students and return them.
* **Live Search:** Search for books by title or author instantly.
* **Smart Validation:** The system stops you from deleting a book if it is currently issued to someone.
* **Transaction History:** Keeps a log of who borrowed which book and when.

##  Tech Stack
* **Language:** Java (JDK 17)
* **GUI:** Java Swing (JFrame, JPanel)
* **IDE:** IntelliJ IDEA
* **Concepts Used:** OOPs (Inheritance, Polymorphism), Exception Handling, Collections Framework, and File I/O.

##  How to Run It
